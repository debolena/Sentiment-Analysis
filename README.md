# Sentiment-Analysis

In this sentiment analysis project, I adapted the Students Performance dataset by focusing on textual feedback or comments—such as open-ended responses or qualitative observations (if available)—to analyze sentiment and understand student perspectives or challenges. The text data was preprocessed through steps including stopword removal, tokenization, and lemmatization to clean and standardize the input. Using techniques like TF-IDF vectorization and a logistic regression classifier, we categorized sentiments into positive, neutral, or negative. Visualizations such as bar plots and word clouds were used to highlight common terms and sentiment distribution across various demographics, like gender or parental education level. This analysis provided insights into how different student groups felt about their academic experience, helping identify factors contributing to satisfaction or frustration. While the structured nature of the dataset limited the depth of sentiment insights, this approach demonstrated how sentiment analysis can complement numerical performance data to provide a fuller picture of student well-being and academic outcomes.
